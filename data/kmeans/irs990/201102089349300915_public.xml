        <Explanation>THE VALUES OF MADISON COUNTY COMMUNITY HOSPITAL (MCCH) INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: RESPECT FOR PEOPLE, STEWARDSHIP OF RESOURCES AND COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE. RESPECT FOR PEOPLE: MCCH TREATS EVERYONE WITH KINDNESS AND RESPECT. STEWARDSHIP OF RESOURCES: MCCH MANAGES THE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO THEM IN A RESPONSIBLE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE: MCCH CONTINUOUSLY STRIVES TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE IN ALL AREAS, PROMOTE A CULTURE OF INTEGRITY AND HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS, MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF PATIENT CARE AND UNDERSTAND AND MEET THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY MCCH. MCCH PROVIDES SERVICE TO ALL PERSONS WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, DISABILITY, DIAGNOSIS, AGE OR ABILITY TO PAY. SINCE OPENING IN 1962, THEIR FAMILY-FRIENDLY SYSTEM HAS ENSURED THAT QUALITY HEALTH CARE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO ENTER THEIR DOORS. WHILE MCCH CONSTANTLY STRIVES TO IMPROVE THEIR FACILITIES AND SERVICES, ONE GOAL REMAINS THE SAME: MCCH IS A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WITH A COMMUNITY SPIRIT; A PLACE WHERE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN COUNT ON PERSONAL CARE, CLOSE TO HOME. ABOUT MCCH: QUALITY CARE IS ABOUT MORE THAN THE SIZE OF A HOSPITAL. IT'S ABOUT CARING FOR PATIENTS WITH COMPETENCE, COMMITMENT, AND COMPASSION. AT MCCH, PATIENTS RECEIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE FROM WELL-TRAINED PHYSICIANS AND EXPERIENCED, DEDICATED CAREGIVERS. THEIR FACILITIES ALLOW FOR A COMFORTABLE STAY, WHETHER PATIENTS ARE AT MCCH FOR A FEW HOURS, A FEW DAYS, OR AN EXTENDED TIME. THEIR STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT, DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES, AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS HELP RESTORE PATIENTS TO GOOD HEALTH IN THE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE. ON NOVEMBER 1, 1999, MCCH FORMED A UNIQUE AFFILIATION WITH THE OSU/MOUNT CARMEL HEALTH ALLIANCE, EXPANDING THEIR RANGE OF SERVICES. THESE MEDICAL FAMILY TIES ALLOW MCCH TO PROVIDE PATIENTS EVEN MORE OF THE BEST QUALITY CARE, CLOSE TO HOME. MCCH'S TEAM OF CAREGIVERS MANAGES MORE THAN 50,000 PATIENT VISITS EACH YEAR, PROVIDING A BROAD RANGE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THESE SERVICES INCLUDE EXTENSIVE INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS, COMPREHENSIVE WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE RESOURCES, UP-TO-DATE IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND EMERGENCY CARE. BEYOND THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE MCCH PROVIDES, THEY ARE ALSO PROUD TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY. PATIENTS SEE MCCH'S PHYSICIANS SITTING NEXT TO THEM IN CHURCH, THEIR NURSES SHOPPING AT THE GROCERY STORE AND THEIR STAFF MEMBERS PLAYING INTRAMURAL SOFTBALL. CARING FOR THE COMMUNITY IS MCCH'S BUSINESS, AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT WELL IS TO DO IT RIGHT. CARDIO-PULMONARY: CARDIOLOGISTS AT MCCH OFFER AN ARRAY OF TESTS AND PROCEDURES TO MAKE SURE THE PATIENT'S HEART IS HEALTHY AND TO FIND ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY BECOME LIFE THREATENING. MCCH'S CARDIOLOGISTS PROVIDE CONSULTATIONS TO DETERMINE THE BEST CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. CARDIOLOGY SERVICES INCLUDE: -ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY (EKGS) -RHYTHM MONITORING -CARDIAC EVENT RECORDING -24-HOUR HALTER MONITORING -24-HOUR AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING -CARDIAC STRESS TESTING -HEAD-UP TILT TABLE TESTING -SIGNAL AVERAGED EKGS -ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY WITH 2-D COLOR FLOW DOPPLER RESPIRATORY THERAPY: RESPIRATORY THERAPY PROVIDES HELP FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MANY KINDS OF ILLNESSES AND INJURIES RELATED TO THE LUNGS INCLUDING PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA, HEART FAILURE, PNEUMONIA, STROKE, SMOKE INHALATION, DROWNING, AND OTHER CONDITIONS. RESPIRATORY CARE INCLUDES DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATIONS TO FIND THE CAUSES OF BREATHING DISORDERS AND HOW TO CARE FOR THEM. MCCH'S THERAPISTS ALSO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INFORM PATIENTS HOW TO USE BREATHING APPARATUS AND OTHER TOOLS TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. SLEEP LAB: A GOOD NIGHT'S REST CAN BE HARD TO ACHIEVE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE APPROXIMATELY 20 MILLION AMERICANS WHO SUFFER FROM SLEEP APNEA. SLEEP APNEA IS CHARACTERIZED BY BRIEF INTERRUPTION OF BREATHING DURING SLEEP. THE DISORDER IS A SERIOUS, POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE SLEEP APNEA, THE MCCH SLEEP DISORDERS CENTER IS THERE TO HELP. THE HOSPITAL SLEEP LAB TESTS FOR TWO TYPES OF SLEEP APNEA: CENTRAL APNEA, WHICH OCCURS IN ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT OF APNEA PATIENTS, AND OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA, THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO CONDITIONS. THE ONLY WAY TO DIAGNOSE SLEEP APNEA IS THROUGH A SPECIALIZED TEST KNOWN AS A POLYSOMNOGRAPHY OR SLEEP STUDY. THE TESTING PROCESS IS SIMPLE. ANYONE WHO SUSPECTS THEY HAVE SLEEP APNEA, OR HAS A BED PARTNER WHO HAS NOTICED SNORING AND BREATHING IRREGULARITIES, IS ASKED TO CONSULT THEIR PHYSICIAN. THE DOCTOR THEN REFERS THE PATIENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A SLEEP STUDY. ONCE THE REFERRAL IS MADE, A MEMBER OF THE SLEEP CENTER STAFF CONTACTS THE PATIENT BY PHONE TO CONDUCT A PRE-SLEEP STUDY QUESTIONNAIRE. THE STAFF MEMBER EXPLAINS WHAT TO EXPECT OF THE TEST, WHAT TO WEAR AND ASKS IF THE PATIENT HAS SPECIAL REQUESTS. FOR INSTANCE, SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY WANT TO BRING THEIR PILLOW FROM HOME OR HAVE A RADIO OR FAN RUNNING WHILE THEY SLEEP. THE CENTER DOES ITS BEST TO SIMULATE THE PATIENT'S NORMAL SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT. THE TEST REQUIRES JUST ONE NIGHT OF SLEEP FROM THE PATIENT, COMPRISED OF SIX TO EIGHT HOURS. A TECHNICIAN MONITORS THE INDIVIDUAL FROM THE ROOM NEXT DOOR. IN THE MORNING, THE PATIENT IS RELEASED AND THE DATA COLLECTED THE NIGHT BEFORE IS INTERPRETED BY A PULMONOLOGIST OR NEUROLOGIST. THE RESULTS ARE SENT TO THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN, WHO THEN EXPLAINS TREATMENT OPTIONS SHOULD THE DIAGNOSIS BE CONFIRMED. FOR PATIENTS WITH CENTRAL APNEA, MEDICATION IS THE MOST OFTEN PRESCRIBED TREATMENT. FOR THOSE WITH OBSTRUCTIVE APNEA, MORE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. WEIGHT LOSS COULD REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND/OR INTENSITY OF THE EPISODES. ALSO, SURGERY CAN REMOVE SOFT TISSUE AT THE BACK OF THE THROAT THAT RESTRICTS NIGHT-TIME BREATHING. THE MOST COMMON METHOD OF TREATMENT IS A CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE DEVICE (CPAP). THE DEVICE IS THE SIZE OF A SMALL RADIO AND SITS ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE. THE PATIENT WEARS A MASK OVER THE NOSE CONNECTED TO THE CPAP BY A HOSE. THE MACHINE FORCES AIR INTO THE PATIENT TO KEEP THE THROAT'S SOFT TISSUE OPEN. THOUGH IT SOUNDS UNCOMFORTABLE, MOST PATIENTS ADAPT QUICKLY AND PREFER THE GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP OVER ANY INCONVENIENCE THE CPAP MIGHT CAUSE. WELLNESS CENTER: LIVING AND ENJOYING LIFE TO THE FULLEST ARE KEY COMPONENTS OF A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. FITNESS IS A WAY OF LIFE THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO FUNCTION AND PERFORM AT THEIR BEST. IT'S A HARMONIC BALANCE OF PRESCRIBED EXERCISE, EATING HABITS AND PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE. THE WELLNESS CENTER IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE AEROBIC EFFICIENCY, MUSCULAR ENDURANCE AND BODY COMPOSITION THROUGH THE USE OF TREADMILLS, STATIONARY BIKES, A STAIR CLIMBER AND STRENGTH-TRAINING EQUIPMENT. ONCOLOGY/CHEMOTHERAPY: MCCH OFFERS CANCER TREATMENT SERVICES INCLUDING DIAGNOSIS, SURGERY, AND CHEMOTHERAPY. ONCOLOGY PATIENTS AT MCCH HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST ADVANCED TREATMENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE ANYWHERE. THROUGH MCCH'S PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ZANGMEISTER CENTER IN COLUMBUS, MCCH CONTINUES TO DEVELOP MORE SERVICES RELATED TO CANCER CARE, INCLUDING CLINICAL TRIALS. MCCH'S DIRECTOR OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES, DR. TAREK CHIDIAC, IS BOARD CERTIFIED IN BOTH ONCOLOGY AND HEMATOLOGY. HE OFFERS TREATMENTS FOR BLOOD DISORDERS (HEMATOLOGY) SUCH AS ANEMIA, HEMOPHILIA, AND SICKLE CELL IN ADDITION TO ONCOLOGY SERVICES. PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION SERVICES: THE PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION PROGRAM HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY TREAT CHILDREN (AGES BIRTH TO 21 YEARS OF AGE) WITH A VARIETY OF NEUROLOGICAL, DEVELOPMENTAL AND REHABILITATIVE ISSUES. MCCH'S OUTPATIENT PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION TEAM CONSISTS OF A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIALISTS TO HELP YOUR CHILD ACHIEVE MAXIMUM INDEPENDENCE: PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS AND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST. PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR CHILDREN TO GAIN/REGAIN FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE. FOR SOME CHILDREN, THERAPY IS NEEDED TO IMPROVE JOINT RANGE OF MOTION OR STRENGTHENING. FOR MANY PATIENTS, THERAPY INVOLVES WORKING ON DEVELOPMENTAL SKILLS, I.E. ROLLING, SITTING, CRAWLING, WALKING, AND JUMPING. MCCH UTILIZES CREATIVE PLAY TO ENHANCE AN ATMOSPHERE OF FUN, MOTIVATING THE CHILD TO ACQUIRE THE SKILLS NEEDED TO IMPROVE HIS OR HER ENVIRONMENT. ADULT OUTPATIENT REHABILITATION SERVICES: OUTPATIENT REHABILITATION AT MCCH PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE REGAIN THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNCTION. WHETHER THE PATIENT IS RECOVERING FROM AN INJURY OR ILLNESS, OR JUST NEEDS ASSISTANCE WITH THE CHALLENGES OF DAILY LIFE, MCCH'S REHAB SERVICES TEAM WORKS WITH INDIVIDUALS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR ABILITIES.</Explanation>
      </GeneralExplanation>
      <GeneralExplanation>
        <Explanation>OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY: THE GOAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IS TO RESTORE FUNCTION TO THE BEST OF EACH PATIENT'S ABILITY. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ENABLES MCCH'S PATIENTS TO GAIN SATISFACTION AND INDEPENDENCE BY PERFORMING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING - WORK, PLAY OR SELF-CARE - FOR THEMSELVES. MCCH'S DEDICATED TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS STRIVES TO HELP PATIENTS IMPROVE CIRCULATION, RESTORE MOTION, STRENGTHEN THEIR UPPER BODY, RELIEVE PAIN, AND CORRECT AND PREVENT DEFORMITY. MCCH'S OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY STAFF CAN DESIGN CUSTOM SPLINTING, RECOMMEND ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT, AND WORK TO RESTORE PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE INDEPENDENCE. MCCH'S OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY STAFF CAN HELP PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS CHALLENGES, GUIDING THEM THROUGH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS EXERCISE, SPLINTING, BATHING, DRESSING AND COOKING. COMMON PROBLEMS TREATED WITH OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY: -CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME -STROKE -HAND INJURIES -BRAIN INJURIES -DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS -SPLINT &amp; ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT NEEDS -ENERGY CONSERVATION/JOINT PROTECTION -NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS -URINARY INCONTINENCE PHYSICAL THERAPY AND SPORTS MEDICINE: PHYSICAL THERAPY PROMOTES HEALING AND ASSISTS PATIENTS TO REGAIN MOVEMENT, AND RESTORE FUNCTION TO AN INJURED BODY PART. MCCH'S THERAPISTS ALSO AID IN REBUILDING A PATIENT'S CONFIDENCE AND RELIEVING PAIN AND DISCOMFORT WHILE WORKING TOWARD RECOVERY. COMMON PROBLEMS TREATED WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY: -ORTHOPEDIC INJURIES -SPORTS INJURIES -BACK INJURIES/PAIN -NECK PAIN/INJURIES -STROKE -NEUROLOGICAL IMPAIRMENTS -BALANCE DEFICITS -DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS -PAIN DURING OR AFTER PREGNANCY TREATMENT MAY INCLUDE TECHNIQUES TO DECREASE PAIN AND SWELLING, AS WELL AS EXERCISES TO INCREASE STRENGTH AND MOBILITY. OTHER TREATMENTS INCLUDE THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE, PELVIC OR CERVICAL TRACTION, ELECTRICAL STIMULATION ULTRASOUND, WOUND CARE, GAIT TRAINING, MANUAL THERAPY AND MASSAGE. MCCH'S TREATMENT IS NOT ALL PHYSICAL. EDUCATION ON TOPICS LIKE JOINT PROTECTION, BACK SAFETY, BODY MECHANICS, POSTURE EDUCATION, AND HOME EXERCISE INSTRUCTION ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS. THEIR STAFF PLANS FOR THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS UPON DISCHARGE, AND PROVIDES A CONTINUUM OF CARE. MCCH'S SPORTS MEDICINE PROGRAM PROVIDES CARE FOR ALL SPORTS RELATED INJURIES AND HELPS TO IMPROVE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE. WHATEVER THE PATIENTS SPORT, HAVING THE MCCH SPORTS MEDICINE STAFF ROOTING FOR THE PATIENT CAN HELP THEM MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR ATHLETIC ABILITIES. SPEECH THERAPY: SPEECH THERAPY PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES TO PATIENTS WHO EXHIBIT DIFFICULTY WITH COMMUNICATION. SUCH DIFFICULTIES MAY RESULT FROM: -STROKE -HEAD INJURY -PROGRESSIVE DISEASE -CANCER -VOCAL ABUSE OR MISUSE -DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS -MENTAL RETARDATION -AUTISM WOMEN'S HEALTH: WOMEN'S HEALTH ISSUES CAN BE WIDE-RANGING, CONFUSING AND SOMETIMES FRIGHTENING, WHICH IS WHY MCCH OFFERS A LITTLE EXTRA TLC DURING THE PATIENT'S VISIT. WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT PREGNANCY, MAMMOGRAMS, OR MENOPAUSE, THEIR STAFF OF WOMEN'S HEALTH EXPERTS WILL HELP PATIENTS FIND THE ANSWERS. AT MCCH THE PATIENT IS MORE THAN A PATIENT. THE PATIENTS ARE MCCH'S PARTNERS IN CARING FOR THEIR BODY AND THEIR HEALTH. THROUGH COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS, MCCH'S COMPASSIONATE MEDICAL TEAM FOSTERS A PARTNERSHIP DESIGNED TO HELP THE PATIENT TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR HEALTH. OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY: AT OBSTETRICS &amp; GYNECOLOGY OF LONDON, INC., CONVENIENTLY LOCATED AT 54 WEST HIGH STREET, MCCH RECOGNIZES THAT WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE NEEDS ARE SPECIAL AND COMPLEX. THE PATIENT'S WELL-BEING IS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE MEDICAL PRACTICE. WOMEN EXPERIENCE MANY UNIQUE CHANGES THROUGHOUT LIFE WHICH AFFECT REPRODUCTIVE, SEXUAL, AND OVERALL GENERAL HEALTH. MCCH'S STAFF WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE BEST HEALTH CARE AVAILABLE TO MANAGE THE CHANGING NEEDS OF YOUR BODY. WOMEN OF ALL AGES CAN EXPERIENCE THE FOLLOWING SERVICES IN THE MOST EASILY ACCESSIBLE, TECHNOLOGICALLY-ADVANCED MADISON COUNTY LOCATION FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE: -ANNUAL EXAMS -OBSTETRICAL CARE -FAMILY PLANNING -INFERTILITY -ULTRASOUND -GYNECOLOGICAL SURGERY -PMS DISORDERS -MENOPAUSE -LASER SURGERY -URINARY INCONTINENCE -ADVANCED ENDOSCOPY -BONE DENSITOMETRY* -MAMMOGRAPHY* *SERVICE CONDUCTED AT THE BATTELLE BREAST CARE CENTER LOCATED IN THE PARK AVENUE MEDICAL BUILDING. BONE DENSITOMETRY AND OSTEOPOROSIS: OSTEOPOROSIS IS A POTENTIALLY CRIPPLING DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY THE LOSS OF BONE TISSUE AND A SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FRACTURE. IT AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED 25 MILLION AMERICANS, 80 PERCENT OF WHOM ARE WOMEN. OSTEOPOROSIS IS OFTEN CALLED THE "SILENT DISEASE" BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY SYMPTOMS UNTIL A FRACTURE OCCURS. APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF WOMEN OVER THE AGE OF 50 ARE AT RISK OF SUSTAINING AN OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURE. TODAY, DOCTORS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO DETECT AND TREAT BONE LOSS IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES, SO AS TO PREVENT THE DISEASE OR LESSEN ITS IMPACT. ALSO, SEVERAL DRUG THERAPIES NOW ON THE MARKET HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE IN SLOWING DOWN OR REVERSING THE BONE-LOSS PROCESS. JUST AS NO PHYSICIAN WOULD PRESCRIBE A MEDICATION FOR HYPERTENSION WITHOUT FIRST TAKING THE PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE, THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS SHOULD BEGIN WITH A MEASUREMENT OF THE PATIENT'S BONE MASS OR BONE DENSITY. BONE DENSITOMETRY USES AN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY CALLED DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA) TO SAFELY, ACCURATELY, AND PAINLESSLY MEASURE BONE DENSITY AND THE MINERAL CONTENT OF BONE. DURING A COMPREHENSIVE BONE EVALUATION WITH DXA, THE PATIENT LIES COMFORTABLY STILL ON A PADDED TABLE WHILE THE DXA UNIT SCANS ONE OR MORE AREAS, USUALLY FRACTURE-PRONE AREAS SUCH AS THE SPINE OR HIP. RADIATION EXPOSURE DURING BONE DENSITOMETRY IS LESS THAN THE RADIATION EXPOSURE DURING A COAST-TO-COAST AIRLINE FLIGHT. THE ENTIRE PROCESS TAKES ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO COMPLETE, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF SITES SCANNED. IT INVOLVES NO INJECTIONS OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES, AND PATIENTS REMAIN FULLY CLOTHED. A REPORT WILL BE SENT TO THE PATIENTS DOCTOR THAT CONSISTS OF THEIR DENSITY MEASUREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND BONE LOSS. DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY AT THE BATTELLE BREAST CARE CENTER: STATISTICS SHOW THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT WOMEN WILL GET BREAST CANCER SOMETIME IN HER LIFETIME. THAT IS WHY DOING EVERYTHING A WOMAN CAN TO DETECT PROBLEMS EARLY IS SO IMPORTANT. WIDESPREAD USE OF REGULAR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BREAST CANCER SURVIVAL RATE. THE SUCCESS RATE FOR TREATING BREAST CANCER IS 98 PERCENT IF THE DISEASE IS CAUGHT IN ITS EARLIEST STAGE. THE GE HEALTHCARE SENOGRAPHE DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY SYSTEM PROVIDES PHYSICIANS WITH CLEAR AND PRECISE ALL-DIGITAL IMAGES, RATHER THAN IMAGES ON X-RAY FILM. THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES TO A DIGITAL SYSTEM. AS OPPOSED TO X-RAYS, THE IMAGES ARE CLEAR AND EASY TO READ. DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY OFFERS A BETTER VIEW OF THE BREAST, ESPECIALLY NEAR THE SKIN LINE, CHEST WALL AND IN WOMEN WITH DIVERSE BREAST TISSUE TYPES. THE DIGITAL IMAGE IS READY TO READ WITHIN 10 SECONDS - THERE IS NO LONGER A WAIT FOR FILMS TO BE DEVELOPED TO BE SURE THE IMAGES ARE USABLE. DIGITAL MAMMOGRAMS TAKE AS LITTLE AS HALF THE TIME OF TRADITIONAL FILM MAMMOGRAMS. IF A SECOND OPINION IS NEEDED, THE IMAGE CAN BE SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO A CONSULTING PHYSICIAN VIRTUALLY INSTANTANEOUSLY. MAMMOGRAMS ARE RECOMMENDED ANNUALLY FOR WOMEN ABOVE THE AGE OF 40 AND SOMETIMES FOR WOMEN YOUNGER THAN 40 WHO HAVE HIGH RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS A FAMILY HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER. THE HIGHEST INSTANCES OF BREAST CANCER OCCUR IN WOMEN OVER 50, BUT THE TYPES OF CANCERS THAT OCCUR IN THE OLDER AGE GROUPS ARE USUALLY SLOWER GROWING, SO THE SURVIVAL RATE AMONG THESE WOMEN IS GREATER, ESPECIALLY WHEN CAUGHT EARLY.</Explanation>
