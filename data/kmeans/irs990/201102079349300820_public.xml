        <Explanation>As of December 31, 2010, the Association's spending policy for endowment funds was to not distribute any amounts from the funds until such assets had reached a minimum of $1 million. Such level was met during 2009, due to one estate gift, from which investment income is restricted to capital campaign projects up to $250,000 over a period of no less than 5 years. Please note that the prior year endowment balances reflect a prior period adjustment to agree to new auditing standards.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Schedule I, Part I, Line 2: Financial Assistance for Membership &amp; Program participation - The heart of the YMCA's mission is to reach out and serve people in our communities who are in need. The YMCA strives to turn no one away based on an inability to pay a program or membership fee. Our Open Doors policy allows individuals and families to access YMCA membership and programs on a sliding-fee scale that is designed to respond to individual circumstances (when a parent loses his/her job, when medical bills become overwhelming, when living on a fixed-income, etc.). Applications and awards of financial assistance are reviewed periodically to determine if same level of award is appropriate, i.e. have circumstances changed for the recipient. Black Achievers Scholarships - All participating high school seniors who were program participants as of the beginning of the previous school year are eligible for scholarships and/or cash awards. Scholarship recipients must complete a two-phase application process that includes submission of their high school transcript, SAT test scores, an essay that elaborates on the students' aspirations, career options, and strengths and weaknesses. The second phase of the application is an interview process. A point system is followed by the Scholarship Committee to evaluate and rank each applicant on the above areas. Payments are made directly to the college or university which the student will be attending after proof of acceptance is supplied to the Scholarship Committee. Cash awards are also made directly to the college/university each participant is attending on their behalf based on the number of career cluster meetings they have attended since their junior year of high school. Stokes Family YMCA College Scholarships - Applications from local high school seniors are accepted and evaluated by a group of volunteers and staff based on financial need, scholastics, community involvement, volunteer hours, YMCA involvement and spirituality. Finalists are chosen from the applications - 3 from each high school - and interviews are conducted. Three recipients are selected based on how they present themselves in the interviews, if their financial needs have changed, and how they plan to use the scholarship if selected. Cash awards are made directly to the college/university of each recipient to be used for tuition only.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Mission: Helping people reach their God-given potential in spirit, mind and body. Values: Caring, honesty, respect, responsibility, and faith are the values we strive to weave into every YMCA program and, we believe, build the moral and ethical foundation for life. Profile: The Young Men's Christian Association of Northwest North Carolina is an association of men, women, and children of all ages, abilities, incomes, races, and religions. Serving Forsyth, Davie, Stokes, Wilkes, and Yadkin counties, our YMCA, through the dedicated efforts of volunteers, members, and paid staff, provides programs that promote youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. The YMCA of Northwest North Carolina is comprised of ten facility branches, one non-facility branch, a resident camp, and an administrative office. Priority Goals: 1. Prepare youth and teens to succeed 2. Strengthen and support families 3. Develop caring communities 4. Adopt healthy living habits Members: As of December 31, 2010, membership totaled 66,749 people, with 16,761 under the age of 18 and 10,381 over the age of 65. In addition, 34,594 individuals were program members of the YMCA, participating in child care, summer camp, swim lessons, mentoring programs, etc. 78% of program members were under the age of 18. Approximately 20% of all members and 29% of program participants received charitable financial assistance valued at $1.5 million. Donors: 6,302 individuals made a charitable contribution to the YMCA's annual Partner with Youth campaign. The campaign raised $1,442,305 in support of the Y's financial assistance program, which includes some special events held specifically for the purpose of the campaign. Volunteers: Volunteers are a vital part of the success of the YMCA. In 2010, 3,274 individuals volunteered at the YMCA in roles as varied as youth sports coaches, literacy tutors, mentors to teens, or board/committee members. Volunteer hours given to the YMCA and their value were estimated to be 119,600 hours and $2.2 million, respectively. Financial Assistance Policy: The heart of the YMCA's mission is to reach out and serve people in our communities who are in need. The YMCA strives to turn no one away based on an inability to pay a program or membership fee. Our Open Doors policy allows individuals and families to access YMCA membership and programs on a sliding-fee scale that is designed to respond to individual circumstances (when a parent loses his/her job, when medical bills become overwhelming, when living on a fixed-income, etc.). Applications and awards of financial assistance are reviewed periodically to determine if same level of award is appropriate, i.e. have circumstances changed for the recipient. The YMCA's efforts to build strong kids, strong families and strong communities are enhanced through collaborations with other community-serving groups, a partial list of which includes: Public and private schools Forsyth Technical Community College American Cancer Society Wake Forest Univ. Baptist Medical Ctr. American Red Cross Winston-Salem State University Partnership for a Drug-Free NC Forsyth-Stokes Mental Health Assoc.

        <Explanation>Health &amp; Wellness 1. The familiar YMCA triangle emphasizes the oneness of spirit, mind and body. YMCA health enhancement programs achieve this unity through programs that stress proper exercise, nutrition, stress management, avoidance of drug and alcohol abuse and health education. 2. YMCA members have the opportunity to participate in wellness activities such as: aerobics, weight training, strength training, personal fitness, cycling, aquatic programs and other fitness classes. 3. During 2010, our association conducted over 40 health fairs, screenings, and information sessions, working with five county health departments, the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, Positive Wellness Alliance, all local colleges and universities, NC Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Coalition, NC Division of Child Development, Smart Start of Forsyth County and area hospitals and businesses to provide important wellness information to the community. Additionally, over 3,500 individuals participated in Healthy Kids Day, a family event held at all branches in the association. 4. PACES, Program for Active Children Eating Smarter, was established by the YMCA of Northwest North Carolina with a grant from the Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust to focus on both prevention and intervention of childhood obesity in our community. Recognizing that children cannot battle this problem alone, PACES includes diet and wellness-related education and activities for the whole family. The PACES Intervention Program participants (ages 10-14) are referred by school counselors, physicians and other concerned professionals. The program provides three hours of physical activities per week in addition to one parent/child meeting per week. Each child is assessed for fitness levels, nutritional habits, behavior and self-image. Individual goals and objectives are established for each child. During 2010, 41 participants were enrolled in the program. The PACES Prevention Program is focused on students in second to fourth grade at five schools. The YMCA provides structured fitness programs during recess for the entire school year for over 1,400 children. Each child is assessed for fitness levels and nutritional habits. Pre and post testing is performed to measure the outcomes of the program. 5. The YMCA offers Get on Your Weigh (formerly Y-Weigh), a 12-week weight management program with small team wellness coaching, realistic weight loss goal-setting and nutritional classes, in every branch. In 2010, the program helped 288 men and women develop healthy lifestyle changes. 6. In 2010, the YMCA continued its partnership with the Millennium Stroke Recovery Team in a stroke recovery program that was offered at four branches. 7. The YMCA provides nursery and child watch services (children ages 3 months-5 years) so that parents and older siblings may participate in YMCA health and wellness activities. 8. The Stokes Family Branch offers a grant-funded outreach program that emphasizes health and physical activity to preschoolers in child care centers throughout Stokes County. A coordinator travels to sites to deliver health information and physical fitness training for children 2 to 5 years old. Participation over the course of the year included 280 children at 8 different sites and 28 classroooms. 9. The Yadkin Family YMCA partners with Yadkin County Schools for students to utilize the YMCA facility 2 days each week for physical education requirements for the Success Academy and Boonville Elementary, serving approximately 30 children each week during the school year. 10. In 2010, the YMCA provided transportation to a group of 12 developmentally disabled students, a teacher and caregivers from the Enrichment Center to the William G. White Jr. Family YMCA (WGW) to participate in group fitness classes. These classes consisted of Zumba, Body Pump, and water aerobics. An Enrichment Center staff has been trained and certified to teach group exercise classes at the Enrichment Center to add wellness to their curriculum. Also, an additional day each month was added when transporation is provided to the students so that they can volunteer at WGW. The students help greet members as they enter the facility to help the students build confidence when speaking to others and increase overall social interaction skills. 11. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities and all incomes. YMCA financial assistance policies help low-income people, who are less likely to exercise and have adequate health care, gain access to the YMCA.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Child Care 1. Before/after and out of school programs provide child care for youngsters 5 - 15 years of age meeting the needs of working parents during the school year. Programs include sports, group games, values education, asset development, healthy snacks and tutoring while serving approximately 2,300 youth (495 before school and 1,836 after school) at 38 school sites, 4 YMCA branches, and a community center. Parent Advisory Committees and the YMCA Model Child Care Curriculum help guide and direct the Before/After School Child Care Programs. 2. The goals of the YMCA's 21st Century Community Learning Centers' "Action Afterschool" program and BLAST program (Better Learning Afterschool Today) funded by TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) are to provide a safe, structured, healthy after-school environment in Title I schools for at-risk elementary school students and their families. The Title I schools being served are located in neighborhoods or serve students from neighborhoods that have many or all of the risk factors stated below: (a) low achievement, (b) high poverty, (c) juvenile crime, (d) high level of students performing below grade level, (e) high drop out rate, (f) high teen pregnancy rates, (g) high student mobility, (h) under skilled caregivers, (i) limited English proficiency , and (j) poor health and nutrition practices. The programs serve four elementary schools between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday with a current enrollment of over 325. The program components consist of homework assistance and tutoring, a healthy snack, physical fitness, health emphasis, and enrichment. The program aims to lower the achievement gap, reduce disciplinary actions and involvement in juvenile crime, improve school attendance, increase parental involvement, improve health and nutrition practices and provide strong character development opportunities. 3. In 2010, the YMCA provided a nutritious healthy snack to 15 mainly at risk after school care sites. Also, a healthy lunch and snack was provided to one Child Development Center. Overall the program served approximately 390 children. This program was possible due to funding from the NCDHHS Child and Adult Care Food Program. In addition to the healthy snack, the kids also participated in physical activities and healthy lifestyle tutoring. 4. In 2010, the YMCA of Northwest North Carolina hosted the fall Christian Leadership Conference (CLC) at Camp Hanes. 90 attendees from approximately 15 different YMCAs and three states attended training workshops with a Christian emphasis in programming and fellowship. CLC is a longstanding program in the YMCA, and due to the many successful CLCs, the YMCA of Northwest North Carolina has been selected again to host the event in the fall of 2011. 5. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities, and all incomes. YMCA financial assistance policies help low-income people, who are less likely to exercise and have adequate health care, gain access to the YMCA.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Camping &amp; Outdoor Education 1. Day camping provides full day recreational, educational and/or specialized child care for youth ages 5 - 13 (14 and 15 year-olds enter our Counselor-In-Training (CIT) Program to become summer camp counselors at age 16). Multiple day camp and sports camp sites across 5 counties provide a variety of opportunities during the summer for group games, swimming, and arts and crafts. Educational camp collaborates with local schools and summer school programs to provide a summer enrichment program. Sports camps teach basketball, soccer, volleyball and good sportsmanship skills. Approximately 1,000 youth per day were served. 2. Resident camping is designed to help campers promote their spiritual awareness, mental development, physical well-being, self-esteem, social growth, and respect for the environment. In 2010, summer camper weeks (one child attending camp for one week) totaled 2,366. There were 52 teens participating in leadership development programs, 97 teen adventure campers, 7 international camp counselors, and 200 American Diabetic Association campers. The goals of the program included teaching life skills while developing an appreciation of nature and an understanding of positive group living and independence. 4. Non-summer Conference/Retreat Program is designed to allow campers the same opportunities as a resident camper except on a smaller scale over a long weekend. The Conference Center was utilized by over 7,300 individuals from 117 different groups in 2010. The Environmental Education Program involved 5,770 students in 2010 from over 60 different schools. This program provides training for local school science teachers in environmental awareness, appreciation and conservation. The teachers then bring their science classes to camp for a hands-on environmental education experience. 5. Adventure Trips and Horseback Riding Programs are offered during summer camp sessions to give many youth their first experience ever with caving, white water rafting and horses. In 2010, 267 campers participated in the Adventure Trips and Horseback Riding Programs. 6. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities, and all incomes. YMCA financial assistance policies help low-income people, who are less likely to exercise and have adequate health care, gain access to the YMCA.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Community &amp; Family Outreach 1. The Graduating Our Future Initiative is a United Way funded collaborative with the YMCA of Northwest North Carolina, Family Services Inc, Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County School system. The collaboration is a comprehensive program designed to address the high school graduation rates within Parkland Magnet High School, Atkins High School, Carver High School, Philo Magnet Academy and Mineral Springs Middle school. The elements of academic support, family support, student engagement and positive role modeling are all integral parts in our approach to addressing high school graduation and truancy. Key components include after school tutoring, concentrated tutoring efforts focused around end-of-course testing, a two-week summer transition program for rising 6th, 7th and 9th grades, counseling and mentoring. In 2010, there were more than 11,450 tutoring hours documented and 231 students benefited from the summer transition programs. 2. Raising literacy levels is an integral part of our mission of "Helping people reach their God-given potential in spirit, mind and body." The YMCA of Northwest North Carolina provides an array of literacy services primarily through our principal program, the Literacy Initiative - an adult reading one-on-one tutorial program for both native English speakers, as well as, English as a Second Language (ESL). During 2010, the Adult Reading Program served 55 students with 36 volunteers. The ESL Program served 74 students with 57 volunteers. The El Nido Family Literacy Program uses the Motheread/Fatheread model to teach literacy and English language skills to immigrant families in the evenings. During 2010, 40 families received this service at no cost. The Toyota Family Literacy Program uses the same model, but takes place during the school day and served approximately 45 families in 2010 at no cost. Our Davie Reads program, also a one-on-one tutorial program, served 23 people in 2010, most of whom were learning English as a second language. 3. In recognition of the National Day of Prayer, each of the YMCA facilities hosted an annual Prayer Breakfast in May. These events brought together over 850 members of the communities served to pray, fellowship, hear speakers and music. 4. YMCA Adventure Guides is a parent-child program designed to help foster understanding and companionship, and to strengthen the relationship between children and their fathers. Participants join a "Circle" of other father/child groups and participate in games, camping trips, ceremonies and family adventures. Adventure Guide compass points - family, nature, community, fun and the YMCA character development values - provide a sense of direction and inspiration for activities. The immediate gain of YMCA Adventure Guides is evident - spending time together - but the long term gains are even more significant in the relationships built between parents and children. In 2010, this program served 467 fathers and children. 5. The YMCA of Northwest North Carolina has strong international ties through long standing partnerships with YMCAs in Mexico and the Ukraine. Our relationships have fostered child care and preschool programs in Mexico and an HIV/AIDS education in Ukraine. Additionally, these international relationships have provided internship opportunities on both sides, as well as service learning camps for our own young people. 6. The International Achievers program is a mentoring program for Hispanic ESL high school students (grades 9-12). The program is designed to address the growing drop-out rate of Hispanic students in the Forsyth County high schools. It was first offered Reynolds High School in 2006 and in February 2007 reached out to students at North Forsyth High School, East Forsyth High School and Parkland Magnet High School. International Achievers partners with Hispanic and bilingual professionals (Adult Achievers) in career fields such as finance, media/communications, business, health/medical, education, and law/government and encourages academic achievement, social development and personal growth among Hispanic youth. Internationl Achievers uses a career-based curriculum and offers monthly Lunch and Learn sessions as well as a diverse choice of monthly educational field trips and an end-of-year recognition banquet. In 2010, International Achievers served 225 youth through the mentoring of 38 volunteers (Adult Achievers). The original Achievers Program was funded by a federal grant from the Department of Education. It is now funded by United Way and also sponsored by the Hispanic League of the Piedmont Triad. 7. Through collaboration with the Second Harvest Food Bank, we operate a Kids Cafe in the LeDeara Crest community. Kids Cafe is an after school program where students receive assistance with homework, enrichment activities and a nutritious dinner. During 2010, the Cafe served a total of 25 students. 8. The Older Adult Program develops seniors into an active, health-conscious social circle of friends and participants. This program is structured for active (or not so active if they so choose) older adults. Organized trips are planned on a monthly basis from September through May for both YMCA members and non-YMCA members. The group is encouraged to attend free monthly health-related workshops presented by various professionals from Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and Best Health. Fitness classes developed especially for older adults are also available. 9. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities, and all incomes. YMCA financial assistance policies help low-income people gain access to the YMCA.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Team Sports &amp; Skill Development 1. Team sports are provided at both the youth and adult levels. The youth basketball program had over 3,000 boys and girls under the age of 18 participate and they were coached by over 500 volunteer coaches. Each youngster played a minimum of one-half of each game with a values session conducted before each game. The program collaborates with local school systems and churches in order to have adequate gym space. Other team sports include youth soccer (2,500+), flag football (550+), adult basketball (56 teams), youth baseball (780+), volleyball (230+), and roller &amp; field hockey (50+). With all YMCA sports, the intent is for the participants to have fun while learning to play the sport in an environment that places winning as secondary. Parents and volunteers work together to make each season special for every team member. 2. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities, and all incomes.

        <Explanation>Aquatics &amp; Water Safety 1. Lessons in swimming teach aquatic skills to youth and adults (ages 6 months through senior citizens). Swimming is a life long activity that improves health and fitness in addition to teaching kids and families to be safe in and around water. At the Davie Family YMCA, a partnership with the Davie County Schools and the United Way of Davie County provides every 2nd grade student with the opportunity to learn how to be safe in and around water through the Water Safety Education. In 2010, 520 students received this instruction at a value of over $40,000. 2. Over 200 children and adults of all income levels took part in one free week of water safety awareness/swim lessons at the Wilkes Family YMCA. Additionally, we partnered with the Wilkes County Schools' More at Four program to provide swim lessons for 734 pre-K students. These free services have a value of over $60,000 and are funded in part by the United Way of Wilkes County ($35,000). 3. The aquatic environment offers a much needed diverse change in everyday life for those with special needs. It opens up opportunities and structure for those challenged in many ways. We work with other agencies and schools to offer a safe, fun environment for mental and physical classes in structured swimming. From autistic individuals, to those with sight impairment, everyone is welcomed to the aquatic environment to learn and grow from their experiences. We have many participants in our YMCAs that also participate in the Special Olympics and the Piedmont Plus Senior Games. 4. Warm water recreational activities/exercises help improve activities for daily living and provide rehabilitation activity for those recovering from auto accidents and strokes. Activities also improve range of motion and joint mobility for people with arthritis or senior citizens who wish to improve their level of fitness as well as socialization. 5. Aquatic safety and lifeguard training provides opportunities for individuals to further develop aquatic safety skills for YMCAs, local pools and homeowners' associations. Classes are offered throughout the year. 6. Competitive and developmental swimming provides activities for swimmers of all ages from four years old through adult. This program not only improves physical fitness and enhances aquatic skills, but also teaches the importance of teamwork, goal orientation and time management. Over 385 swimmers were directly involved with our year-round YMCA swim team with an additional 500+ area summer league swimmers involved in YMCA sponsored competitive events. During 2010, our YMCA swimmers participated in various national and international events and boasts two graduating seniors who will be receiving college scholarships for their swimming efforts, as well as, a YMCA National Champion. YMCA aquatic facilities are also utilized by area high school swim teams for practices and competitions. 7. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities and all incomes. YMCA financial assistance policies help low-income people, who are less likely to exercise and have adequate health care, gain access to the YMCA.</Explanation>

        <Explanation>Youth &amp; Teen Leadership 1. Our Youth &amp; Government Program introduces local middle and high school students to the legislative process of city, county, state, national, and international governments through a hands-on approach. Programs such as Youth Legislature (culminates with a weekend trip to the state capital in Raleigh where the students author, introduce and vote to accept or reject bills of their own creation), Conference on National Affairs, and Model UN enable young people to prepare for moral and political leadership through training in the theory and practice of developing public policy. Students sharpen their leadership skills and improve their problem solving and critical thinking abilities while becoming more adept at debating and public speaking. In 2010, over 470 students from middle and high schools within our Association participated in these programs, many returning home with recognition awards and having been elected to a state office by their peers. 2. Leader's Club is a leadership training program based on physical education that not only helps middle and high school students in their personal health and fitness goals but allows them to learn how to lead others in achieving their fitness goals. Volunteer service and community service are key components to this teen leadership program. Participants attend lectures that range from business etiquette to public speaking. The program is designed to foster good citizenship, moral responsibility and civic involvement. In 2010, approximately 25 students in two counties participated in this program. 3. The Black Achievers Program gives teens (9th - 12th grade) in Forsyth County direct access to 40 volunteer leaders (adult achievers) representing business and industry, public health and safety, education and community based organizations. Our volunteers serve as role models and nurturing figures who emphasize the importance of education. The program provides career exploration with student achievers working with adult achievers to learn about different career paths - architecture and engineering, health and medical, business, education, computers, etc. Additionally, college preparation is encouraged with SAT preparation and college tours being a part of the nine-month program. The graduating teens compete for college scholarships and awards. 4. Each month, an average of 400 middle school and high school kids gather at Ys in all five counties (on either Friday or Saturday nights) from 6 p.m. until 11 p.m. to participate in games, activities, swimming, team building and asset development. These programs ("Middle School Madness" or "Saturday Night Live") offer a safe alternative to kids ages 12 to 16. 5. YMCA programs are designed to attract people of all ages, all abilities and all incomes. YMCA financial assistance policies help low-income people gain access to the YMCA.</Explanation>
